# RFM-K-Means-Analysis

## Abstract
The paper presents the overall work that our group has done as the final project. The main purpose of this project was to choose a particular set of techniques and strategies that we have learned during the span of the course and apply those to a real-life case. Our group has decided to conduct customer segmentation (clustering) using two techniques: RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering. This paper contains all the details regarding the work done by our group: The introduction to the topic, information about the data that we have used and its content, the findings after the manipulation of the data and their visualizations, then - about how we have used each technique for customer analysis and the findings based on them, that is the same as the customer clustering/segmentation results. In addition, the interpretation of each analysis and its findings is also included in the paper, as well as the overall conclusion of the project that is based on the steps and findings of the analyses.
